# Python Algorithm for File Updates
## Portfolio Project from Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

### Scenario: 
A cybersecurity professional at a healthcare company regularly updates a file listing employees authorized to access restricted content based on their handling of patient records. Access was restricted by IP address, with an allow list for permitted IPs and a remove list for exclusions. The task is to develop a Python algorithm to remove IPs listed on the remove list from the allow list.

### Project description
